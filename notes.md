Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user.

When the user completes a game - win or lose - they should be prompted to begin another one.

The program should only use console output; no graphics are needed.

Extensions
Different coloured output for a win, loss, or draw
The game should keep track of the user's results, and display them when prompted
Any additional features that you wish
Guidance
Start with pseudocode
Build a minimum viable product (MVP): build the simplest possible form of the game, and then make it more complicated
You will have to do some research to work out how to solve specific problems
